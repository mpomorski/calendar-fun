#Why the project has been bootstrapped with Create React App

##Date
2020-12-09

##Context
In order to start working on the actual feature I needed to set up a project.
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a comfortable environment and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

##Decision
Due to time constraints and lack of immediate requirements like server-side rendering I decided to get a head start with Create React App.

##Consequences
Create React App comes with lots of dependencies that are not necessarily needed. That will result in maintenance headaches. Also, project will contain a lot of noise if ever needs to be 'ejected'.
